# Action: fivetran_connection_schema_reload

~> **Preview** This action is in preview. Its behavior and interface may change in future releases without prior notice.

This action triggers a schema reload for a Fivetran connection. It discovers new schemas, tables, and columns from the source and makes them available for configuration.

The action is typically triggered via a `lifecycle.action_trigger` on the connection resource after creation, ensuring the schema is loaded before any schema configuration resources are applied.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "fivetran_connector" "my_connector" {
  group_id = "my_group_id"
  service  = "postgres"

  destination_schema {
    prefix = "my_schema"
  }

  config {}

  lifecycle {
    action_trigger {
      events  = [after_create]
      actions = [action.fivetran_connection_schema_reload.reload]
    }
  }
}

action "fivetran_connection_schema_reload" "reload" {
  config {
    connection_id = fivetran_connector.my_connector.id
    exclude_mode  = "PRESERVE"

    timeouts = {
      invoke = "30m"
    }
  }
}
```
