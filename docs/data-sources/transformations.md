### Nested Schema for `transformations`

Required:

- `id` (String) The unique identifier for the dbt Transformation within the Fivetran system.

Read-Only:

- `created_at` (String) The timestamp of when the transformation was created in your account.
- `created_by_id` (String) The unique identifier for the User within the Fivetran system who created the transformation.
- `output_model_names` (Set of String) Identifiers of related models.
- `paused` (Boolean) The field indicating whether the transformation will be set into the paused state. By default, the value is false.
- `schedule` (Block, Read-only) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--transformations--schedule))
- `status` (String) Status of transformation Project (NOT_READY, READY, ERROR).
- `transformation_config` (Block, Read-only) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--transformations--transformation_config))
- `type` (String) Transformation type.

<a id="nestedblock--transformations--schedule"></a>
### Nested Schema for `transformations.schedule`

Read-Only:

- `connection_ids` (Set of String) Identifiers of related connectors.
- `cron` (Set of String) Cron schedule: list of CRON strings.
- `days_of_week` (Set of String) The set of the days of the week the transformation should be launched on. The following values are supported: MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY.
