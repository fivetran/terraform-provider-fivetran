## Import

1. To import an existing `fivetran_user` resource into your Terraform state, you need to get `user_id`. 
You can retrieve all users using the [fivetran_users data source](/docs/data-sources/users).

2. Define an empty resource in your `.tf` configuration:

```hcl
resource "fivetran_user" "my_imported_fivetran_user" {

}
```

3. Run the `terraform import` command:

```
terraform import fivetran_user.my_imported_fivetran_user {user_id}
```

4. Use the `terraform state show` command to get the values from the state:

```
terraform state show 'fivetran_user.my_imported_fivetran_user'
```
5. Copy the values and paste them to your `.tf` configuration.
