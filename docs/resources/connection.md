## Schema

### Required

- `group_id` (String) The unique identifier for the Group (Destination) within the Fivetran system.
- `service` (String) The connection type id within the Fivetran system.

### Optional

- `config` (String) Optional connection configuration as a JSON string. This will be merged with destination_schema fields. The connection resource does not read this field back from the API, allowing it to be managed separately by fivetran_connection_config resource.
- `data_delay_sensitivity` (String) The level of data delay notification threshold. Possible values: LOW, NORMAL, HIGH, CUSTOM. The default value NORMAL. CUSTOM is only available for customers using the Enterprise plan or above.
- `data_delay_threshold` (Number) Custom sync delay notification threshold in minutes. The default value is 0. This parameter is only used when data_delay_sensitivity set to CUSTOM.
- `destination_schema` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--destination_schema))
- `hybrid_deployment_agent_id` (String) The hybrid deployment agent ID that refers to the controller created for the group the connection belongs to. If the value is specified, the system will try to associate the connection with an existing agent.
- `networking_method` (String) Possible values: Directly, SshTunnel, ProxyAgent.

- `trust_fingerprints` (Boolean) Specifies whether we should trust the SSH fingerprint automatically. The default value is FALSE. If a fingerprint is not trusted automatically, it has to be approved with [Certificates Management API Approve a destination fingerprint](https://fivetran.com/docs/rest-api/certificates#approveadestinationfingerprint).
