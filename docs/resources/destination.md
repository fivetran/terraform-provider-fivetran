## Schema

### Required

- `group_id` (String) The unique identifier for the Group within the Fivetran system.
- `region` (String) Data processing location. This is where Fivetran will operate and run computation on data.
- `service` (String) The destination type id within the Fivetran system.
- `time_zone_offset` (String) Determines the time zone for the Fivetran sync schedule.

### Optional

- `config` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--config))
- `run_setup_tests` (Boolean) Specifies whether the setup tests should be run automatically. The default value is TRUE.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- `trust_certificates` (Boolean) Specifies whether we should trust the certificate automatically. The default value is FALSE. If a certificate is not trusted automatically, it has to be approved with [Certificates Management API Approve a destination certificate](https://fivetran.com/docs/rest-api/certificates#approveadestinationcertificate).

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Setup tests

The `run_setup_tests` field doesn't have upstream value, it only defines local resource behavoir. This means that when you update only the `run_setup_tests` value (from `false` to `true`, for example) it won't cause any upstream actions. The value will be just saved in terraform state and then used on effective field updates.

The default value is `false` - this means that no setup tests will be performed during create/update. To perform setup tests, you should set value to `true`.

## Import

1. To import an existing `fivetran_destination` resource into your Terraform state, you need to get **Destination Group ID** on the destination page in your Fivetran dashboard.
To retrieve existing groups, use the [fivetran_groups data source](/docs/data-sources/groups).
2. Define an empty resource in your `.tf` configuration:

```hcl
resource "fivetran_destination" "my_imported_destination" {

}
```

3. Run the `terraform import` command with the following parameters:

```
terraform import fivetran_destination.my_imported_destination {your Destination Group ID}
```

4. Use the `terraform state show` command to get the values from the state:

```
terraform state show 'fivetran_destination.my_imported_destination'
```
5. Copy the values and paste them to your `.tf` configuration.

-> The `config` object in the state contains all properties defined in the schema. You need to remove properties from the `config` that are not related to destinations. See the [Fivetran REST API documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/rest-api/destinations/config) for reference to find the properties you need to keep in the `config` section.
