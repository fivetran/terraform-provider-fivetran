# Resource: fivetran_destination

This resource allows you to create, update, and delete destinations.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "fivetran_destination" "dest" {
    group_id = fivetran_group.group.id
    service = "postgres_rds_warehouse"
    time_zone_offset = "0"
    region = "GCP_US_EAST4"
    trust_certificates = "true"
    trust_fingerprints = "true"
    run_setup_tests = "true"

    config {
        host = "destination.fqdn"
        port = 5432
        user = "postgres"
        password = "myPass"
        database = "fivetran"
        connection_type = "Directly"
    }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `config` (Block List, Min: 1, Max: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--config))
- `group_id` (String) The unique identifier for the Group within the Fivetran system.
- `region` (String) Data processing location. This is where Fivetran will operate and run computation on data.
- `service` (String) The connector type name within the Fivetran system
- `time_zone_offset` (String) Determines the time zone for the Fivetran sync schedule.

### Optional

- `run_setup_tests` (Boolean) Specifies whether the setup tests should be run automatically. The default value is TRUE.
- `trust_certificates` (Boolean) Specifies whether we should trust the certificate automatically. The default value is FALSE. If a certificate is not trusted automatically, it has to be approved with [Certificates Management API Approve a destination certificate](https://fivetran.com/docs/rest-api/certificates#approveadestinationcertificate).
- `trust_fingerprints` (Boolean) Specifies whether we should trust the SSH fingerprint automatically. The default value is FALSE. If a fingerprint is not trusted automatically, it has to be approved with [Certificates Management API Approve a destination fingerprint](https://fivetran.com/docs/rest-api/certificates#approveadestinationfingerprint).

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier for the destination within the Fivetran system
- `last_updated` (String)
- `setup_status` (String) Destination setup status

- `auth_type` (String) Authentication type. Default value: `PASSWORD`.
- `bucket` (String) Customer bucket. If specified, your GCS bucket will be used to process the data instead of a Fivetran-managed bucket. The bucket must be present in the same location as the dataset location.
- `catalog` (String) Catalog name
- `cluster_id` (String) Cluster ID. Must be populated if `connection_type` is set to `SshTunnel` and `auth_type` is set to `IAM`.
- `cluster_region` (String) Cluster region. Must be populated if `connection_type` is set to `SshTunnel` and `auth_type` is set to `IAM`.
- `connection_type` (String) Connection method. Default value: `Directly`.
- `create_external_tables` (String) Whether to create external tables
- `data_set_location` (String) Data location. Datasets will reside in this location.
- `database` (String) Database name
- `external_location` (String) External location to store Delta tables. Default value: `""`  (null). By default, the external tables will reside in the `/{schema}/{table}` path, and if you specify an external location in the `{externalLocation}/{schema}/{table}` path.
- `host` (String) Server name
- `http_path` (String) HTTP path
- `is_private_key_encrypted` (String) Indicates that a private key is encrypted. The default value: `false`. The field can be specified if authentication type is `KEY_PAIR`.

- `role_arn` (String, Sensitive) Role ARN with Redshift permissions. Required if authentication type is `IAM`.
- `secret_key` (String, Sensitive) Private key of the customer service account. If specified, your service account will be used to process the data instead of the Fivetran-managed service account.
- `server_host_name` (String) Server name
- `tunnel_host` (String) SSH server name. Must be populated if `connection_type` is set to `SshTunnel`.
- `tunnel_port` (String) SSH server port name. Must be populated if `connection_type` is set to `SshTunnel`.

Read-Only:

- `public_key` (String) Public key to grant Fivetran SSH access to git repository.

## Setup tests

The `run_setup_tests` field doesn't have upstream value, it only defines local resource behavoir. This means that when you update only the `run_setup_tests` value (from `false` to `true`, for example) it won't cause any upstream actions. The value will be just saved in terraform state and then used on effective field updates.

The default value is `false` - this means that no setup tests will be performed during create/update. To perform setup tests, you should set value to `true`.

## Import

1. To import an existing `fivetran_destination` resource into your Terraform state, you need to get **Destination Group ID** on the destination page in your Fivetran dashboard.
To retrieve existing groups, use the [fivetran_groups data source](/docs/data-sources/groups).
2. Define an empty resource in your `.tf` configuration:

```hcl
resource "fivetran_destination" "my_imported_destination" {

}
```

3. Run the `terraform import` command with the following parameters:

```
terraform import fivetran_destination.my_imported_destination {your Destination Group ID}
```

4. Use the `terraform state show` command to get the values from the state:

```
terraform state show 'fivetran_destination.my_imported_destination'
```
5. Copy the values and paste them to your `.tf` configuration.

-> The `config` object in the state contains all properties defined in the schema. You need to remove properties from the `config` that are not related to destinations. See the [Fivetran REST API documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/rest-api/destinations/config) for reference to find the properties you need to keep in the `config` section.
