To retrieve existing groups, use the [fivetran_groups data source](/docs/data-sources/groups).
2. Define an empty resource in your `.tf` configuration:

```hcl
resource "fivetran_group" "my_imported_fivetran_group" {

}
```

3. Run the `terraform import` command:

```
terraform import fivetran_group.my_imported_fivetran_group {your Destination Group ID}
```

4. Use the `terraform state show` command to get the values from the state:

```
terraform state show 'fivetran_group.my_imported_fivetran_group'
```

5. Copy the values and paste them to your `.tf` configuration.
