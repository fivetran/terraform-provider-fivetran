You can retrieve all teams using the [fivetran_teams data source](/docs/data-sources/teams).

2. Define an empty resource in your `.tf` configuration:

```hcl
resource "fivetran_team" "my_imported_fivetran_team" {

}
```

3. Run the `terraform import` command:

```
terraform import fivetran_team.my_imported_fivetran_team {team_id}
```

4. Use the `terraform state show` command to get the values from the state:

```
terraform state show 'fivetran_team.my_imported_fivetran_team'
```
5. Copy the values and paste them to your `.tf` configuration.
