# Resource: fivetran_connector_schedule

-This resource allows you to manage connectors schedule: pause/unpause connector, set daily_sync_time and sync_frequency.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "fivetran_connector_schedule" "my_connector_schedule" {
    connector_id = fivetran_connector.my_connector.id

    sync_frequency     = "1440"
    daily_sync_time    = "03:00"

    paused             = false
    pause_after_trial  = true

    schedule_type      = "auto"
}
```

## Import

You don't need to import this resource as it is synthetic. 

To fetch schedule values from existing connector use `fivetran_connector` data source:
```hcl
data "fivetran_connector" "my_connector" {
    id = "my_connector_id"
}

# now you can use schedule values from this data_source:
#   sync_frequency = data.fivetran_connector.my_connector.sync_frequency
#   paused = data.fivetran_connector.my_connector.paused
```

This resource manages settings for already existing connector instance and doesn't create a new one.
If you already have an existing connector with id = `my_connector_id` just define `fivetran_connector_schedule` resource:

```hcl
resource "fivetran_connector_schedule" "my_connector_schedule" {
    connector_id = "my_connector_id"

    sync_frequency     = "360"
    paused             = false
    pause_after_trial  = true
    schedule_type      = "auto"
}
```

-> NOTE: You can't have several resources managing the same `connector_id`. They will be in conflict ater each `apply`.
